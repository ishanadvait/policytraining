(Your Organization's Logo Here) Date: June 2025
Slide 2: Introduction - Why This Training Matters More Than Ever
Understanding Corruption and Bribery
Corruption: The abuse of entrusted power (public or private) for private gain. This can include embezzlement, fraud, extortion, cronyism, and nepotism.
Bribery: The offering, promising, giving, accepting, or soliciting of an undue advantage (financial or otherwise) as an inducement for an action which is illegal, unethical, or a breach of trust, aiming to influence a decision or outcome.
Impact on Businesses: Beyond Fines
Financial Losses: Direct penalties, legal defense costs, investigation expenses, forfeiture of assets, and lost business opportunities.
Reputational Damage: Severe blow to brand image, loss of customer loyalty, negative media scrutiny, difficulty in attracting and retaining talent, and exclusion from tender processes.
Legal Penalties: Imprisonment for individuals (including directors and senior management), corporate liability, debarment from government contracts, and cross-border legal actions.
Operational Disruption: Lengthy investigations, freezing of assets, diversion of management resources, and loss of essential licenses or permits.
Erosion of Trust: Undermines internal morale, fosters a toxic work environment, and damages relationships with stakeholders (partners, investors, public).
Market Distortion: Creates an uneven playing field, stifles innovation, and discourages legitimate investment.
Why Focus on India?
India has a robust and evolving legal framework, with increased enforcement efforts.
Complex regulatory landscape requires careful navigation, especially concerning interactions with public officials.
Growing global scrutiny and extraterritorial laws (like FCPA, UK Bribery Act) demand that companies operating in or with India comply with international best practices.
Training Objectives
To gain a comprehensive understanding of the legal and regulatory framework for anti-corruption and anti-bribery in India.
To accurately identify common red flags and high-risk scenarios within our business operations.
To equip you with practical steps and tools for compliance, prevention, and effective reporting.
To cultivate and reinforce a strong culture of integrity, transparency, and ethical conduct across our organization.
Section: Slide 3: The Indian Legal Landscape: Key Anti-Corruption Laws
Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (PCA) - The Cornerstone (Expanded Content)
Primary legislation in India to combat corruption, specifically targeting public servants.
Broad Definition of "Public Servant" (Section 2(c)): The PCA defines a public servant very broadly, extending beyond traditional government employees. It includes:
Any person in the service or pay of the Government (Central or State).
Employees of local authorities, corporations established by or under Central/State Acts, Government companies, or bodies owned, controlled, or aided by the Government.
Judges, arbitrators, and persons authorized by a court of justice.
Office bearers of registered co-operative societies receiving financial aid from the government.
Employees of educational, scientific, social, cultural, or other institutions receiving substantial government financial assistance.
Even persons performing a public duty for remuneration from the Government or a public body.
Implication: This broad definition means many individuals interacting with or working for government-affiliated entities fall under the purview of this Act, broadening the scope of potential bribery offenses.
Key Offenses & Provisions (Chapter III - Selected in Detail):
Section 7 (Public Servant taking gratification): This section criminalizes a public servant (or anyone acting on their behalf) obtaining, accepting, or attempting to obtain "undue advantage" (a bribe) for performing or forbearing an official act, or for showing favor/disfavor. The "undue advantage" does not need to be monetary; it can be any valuable thing or intangible benefit.
Example: A government official accepting a free trip from a company in exchange for expediting their license application.
Section 8 (Taking gratification to influence public servant by corrupt or illegal means): This targets intermediaries or "middlemen" who obtain or attempt to obtain "undue advantage" (a bribe) to induce a public servant to perform public duty improperly or dishonestly. It also criminalizes giving undue advantage to such a person.
Example: A consultant accepting money from a company to facilitate a favorable government contract through illicit means.
Section 9 (Bribing a public servant by a commercial organisation): This is a crucial section directly addressing corporate criminal liability. It states that if any person associated with a commercial organization (e.g., employee, agent, subsidiary) gives or promises to give an undue advantage to a public servant with the intent to obtain or retain business or an advantage for that organization, the commercial organization is guilty of an offense.
Implication: This means a company can be held liable even if its senior management was unaware of the bribe, provided an "associated person" committed the act for the company's benefit.
Section 10 (Personal liability in commercial organisation offense): This holds the person in charge (director, manager, secretary, or other officer) of the commercial organization liable for the offense under Section 9, unless they prove they exercised due diligence to prevent the offense or that the offense was committed without their knowledge/connivance.
Implication: This places a significant burden on senior management to ensure robust compliance measures are in place.
Section 11 (Public servant obtaining undue advantage without consideration): Criminalizes a public servant obtaining any valuable thing without consideration, or for inadequate consideration, from a person concerned in proceedings or business transacted by the public servant. This covers situations where there's no direct "quid pro quo" but an illicit benefit is received.
Example: A public servant accepting a luxury car from a contractor, with whom they regularly do business, even if no specific favor is immediately requested.
Section 13 (Criminal Misconduct by a Public Servant): Defines various forms of criminal misconduct, including dishonest misappropriation of property, habitual acceptance of gratification, or possession of assets disproportionate to known sources of income.
Section 12 (Punishment for abetment): Makes abetment (instigating or assisting) of offenses under the Act punishable with similar penalties.
2018 Amendments (Strengthening Enforcement & Corporate Accountability):
Explicitly Criminalized Bribe-Giving (Sections 8, 9, 10): This was a pivotal change. Prior to 2018, the PCA primarily focused on the bribe-taker. Now, individuals and commercial organizations offering or promising bribes are equally liable. Even the mere offer of a bribe is now an offense, regardless of whether it was accepted.
Key shift: It moved from a "supply-side" (taker) focus to also include "demand-side" (giver) liability.
Mandatory Prior Sanction (Section 17A): Requires government approval to initiate any inquiry or investigation against a public servant for offenses committed in their official capacity. This aims to protect honest public servants from vexatious prosecutions, but it also means understanding the process for obtaining such sanctions.
Challenge: Can potentially create delays in investigations if not managed efficiently.
Enhanced Penalties: Increased minimum (from 6 months to 3 years) and maximum (from 5 years to 7 years) punishments for various offenses, reflecting a tougher stance on corruption.
Corporate Liability with "Adequate Procedures" Defense (Section 9): Commercial organizations now face direct liability. However, they have an affirmative defense if they can prove they had "adequate procedures" in place to prevent the bribery. This incentivizes robust, proactive compliance programs.
What are "adequate procedures"? While not exhaustively defined, generally align with international best practices: tone from the top, risk assessment, due diligence, training, monitoring, etc.
Trial Timelines: Courts are mandated to endeavor to complete the trial within two years, with a maximum extension of up to four years, aiming for faster justice and reducing delays.
Penalties: Rigorous imprisonment (minimum 3 years, maximum 7 years, depending on the offense), substantial fines (often linked to the amount of gratification), and confiscation/forfeiture of property acquired through corruption.
Slide 4: International Anti-Bribery Laws with Indian Impact
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) - USA (Expanded Content)
Purpose: Enacted in 1977, the FCPA was a landmark piece of legislation to combat bribery of foreign officials. It prevents US companies and individuals from bribing foreign government officials to obtain or retain business, and it mandates accounting transparency.
Applies to ("Jurisdictional Reach"): The FCPA has an extensive global reach, covering:
US Issuers: Any company with securities listed on a US stock exchange (e.g., NYSE, NASDAQ) or that is required to file reports with the SEC (Securities and Exchange Commission). This applies to the issuer itself, its officers, directors, employees, and agents worldwide.
Implication: Even if an Indian company is not primarily US-based but lists its shares (e.g., through American Depository Receipts - ADRs), it becomes an "issuer" and is subject to the FCPA globally.
US Domestic Concerns: Any US citizen, national, resident, or US business entity (including partnerships, associations, corporations, etc.), regardless of whether they are an "issuer."
Implication: A US individual or company, even if small, cannot bribe foreign officials anywhere in the world.
Foreign Persons/Entities: Non-US persons or entities (e.g., an Indian company or individual) who commit an act in furtherance of a corrupt payment while in the territory of the United States.
Broad Reach: This means even a single email sent from the US, a phone call routed through US servers, a meeting held in the US, or a bank transaction processed through a US financial institution related to a bribery scheme can establish FCPA jurisdiction over a foreign entity or individual.
Prohibits: Corrupt offers, payments, promises to pay, or authorization of payments of "anything of value" to a "foreign official" with the corrupt intent to assist in obtaining or retaining business or directing business to any person.
Key Components:
Anti-bribery Provisions: These directly criminalize corrupt payments to foreign officials. The term "anything of value" is interpreted extremely broadly and can include:
Cash or cash equivalents (e.g., gift cards).
Expensive gifts, lavish travel, extravagant meals, entertainment, or excessive favors.
Offers of employment or internships to relatives or associates of officials.
Donations to charities or sponsorships of events at the official's request where there's no legitimate charitable purpose.
Favorable business opportunities, inflated contracts, or "phantom" consulting agreements.
Accounting Provisions: These apply specifically to "issuers" (and their subsidiaries, regardless of location) and are crucial for preventing and detecting bribery. They require issuers to:
Make and Keep Accurate Books and Records: Maintain books, records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the issuer's assets. This directly combats the practice of disguising bribes as legitimate business expenses (e.g., "consulting fees," "commissions," "marketing expenses").
Devise and Maintain a System of Internal Accounting Controls: Implement and maintain a system of internal controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are executed and assets are accessed only with management's authorization, and that financial statements are prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).
Implication: Even if no bribery payment is proven, a company can be found liable under the accounting provisions for having inadequate controls or falsified records if they were used to facilitate potential bribery.
Definition of "Foreign Official": The FCPA's definition is very broad and includes:
Any officer or employee of a foreign government or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof (even low-level employees).
Any person acting in an official capacity for or on behalf of any such government, department, agency, or instrumentality.
Any officer or employee of a public international organization (e.g., World Bank, United Nations, International Monetary Fund).
Any party official or candidate for foreign political office.
Implication: This covers a vast array of individuals with whom businesses might interact, from customs officials to state-owned enterprise employees.
"Facilitation Payments" (Exception & Risks): The FCPA has a narrow exception for "facilitating or expediting payment to a foreign official for performing a routine governmental action."
Routine Governmental Action: This refers to non-discretionary, ministerial acts (e.g., obtaining permits, processing visas, connecting utilities, mail delivery). It does not include decisions involving discretion (e.g., awarding a contract, influencing legislation).
RISK: This exception is extremely narrow and carries significant risk. Many other countries (including India, under the 2018 PCA amendments) do not recognize this exception and explicitly prohibit such payments. The UK Bribery Act also has no such exception. Therefore, our company policy prohibits all facilitation payments to ensure compliance with the broadest possible anti-bribery standards and avoid legal pitfalls.
Affirmative Defenses: While the burden of proof is high, the FCPA does provide two affirmative defenses:
Local Law Defense: The payment was lawful under the written laws and regulations of the foreign country. This defense is rarely successful, as few countries explicitly permit bribery.
Reasonable and Bona Fide Business Expense: The payment was a reasonable and bona fide expenditure, such as travel and lodging expenses, directly related to the promotion, demonstration, or explanation of products or services, or the execution of a contract. This defense is often heavily scrutinized by enforcement agencies to ensure there was no corrupt intent.
Enforcement: Primarily enforced by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) (responsible for criminal actions and imposing corporate monitors) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) (responsible for civil enforcement against issuers).
Impact on Indian Entities:
Indian companies with US listings or reporting obligations to the SEC (e.g., through ADRs/GDRs).
Indian subsidiaries or affiliates of US companies.
Indian companies or individuals involved in joint ventures, partnerships, or M&A with US entities.
Any Indian entity that conducts any part of a bribery scheme (e.g., bank transfers, communications) through US territory, even if the primary corruption occurs in India.
UK Bribery Act, 2010
Broader Scope: Considered one of the strictest anti-bribery laws globally, covering bribery in both the public and private sectors.
Key Offenses:
Section 1: Bribing another person: Offering, promising, or giving a financial or other advantage intending to induce improper performance.
Section 2: Being bribed: Requesting, agreeing to receive, or accepting a financial or other advantage as a reward for improper performance.
Section 6: Bribery of Foreign Public Officials: Specifically targets bribery of non-UK public officials.
Section 7: Failure of commercial organizations to prevent bribery: This is a strict liability corporate offense. A commercial organization can be liable if a person "associated" with it (e.g., employee, agent, subsidiary) bribes another person intending to obtain or retain business, unless the organization can prove it had "adequate procedures" in place to prevent bribery.
Extraterritorial Reach: Applies to any company or individual with a business presence in the UK, regardless of where the bribery offense occurred. This includes foreign companies (e.g., Indian companies) that carry on business or part of a business in the UK.
Impact on Indian Entities:
Indian companies with UK operations, subsidiaries, or branches.
Indian companies with UK-based agents or intermediaries.
Any Indian entity that is considered to have a "business presence" in the UK.
Implications for Indian Businesses in a Globalized World
Even if operating solely in India, companies with international clients, partners, or funding may find themselves indirectly or directly subject to these extraterritorial laws.
Failure to comply can result in multinational investigations, hefty global fines, and simultaneous prosecutions in India and abroad.
Adopting a compliance program that meets international best practices (e.g., ISO 37001) is crucial for managing global risk and demonstrating a commitment to integrity.
Slide 5: Defining Bribery and Corruption in Practice
What Constitutes an "Undue Advantage" or Bribe?
A bribe is anything of value offered, promised, or given to improperly influence an action or decision. The concept of "value" is very broad and not limited to cash. This can include:
Direct Payments: Cash, bank transfers, loans (especially interest-free or below-market rates), gifts of money, lavish meals or entertainment.
Indirect Benefits:
Gifts, Hospitality & Entertainment: This is a common grey area. Excessive, frequent, or lavish gifts, expensive meals, travel, or entertainment not justified by a legitimate business purpose are considered bribes. For example, offering an all-expenses-paid luxury vacation to a client to secure a contract.
Facilitation Payments (Grease Payments): Small payments made to expedite or secure a routine governmental action (e.g., clearing customs, obtaining a visa faster) to which one is already entitled. These are often explicitly illegal under Indian law and strictly prohibited by international laws like the FCPA, even if tolerated locally.
Kickbacks: A portion of a payment or contract value returned to the person who authorized or facilitated the original payment, often disguised as "commissions" or "referral fees."
Nepotism/Cronyism: Unfairly favoring family members or close associates in hiring, promotions, or contract awards, leveraging a position of power for private benefit.
Political Contributions: Donations to political parties or campaigns when given with the intent to improperly influence a public official, gain an unfair business advantage, or secure specific political outcomes.
Charitable Donations/Sponsorships: Payments to charities or sponsorships of events when used as a disguised means of bribery, often lacking transparency, proper due diligence on the recipient organization, or a legitimate charitable purpose.
Preferential Treatment: Any other non-monetary advantage, such as inflated contracts, favorable regulatory treatment, access to confidential information, or providing employment to relatives.
Key Elements of a Bribery Offense (as per Indian and International Laws)
Generally, an act constitutes bribery if there is:
An Offer, Promise, or Grant: The act of proposing, agreeing to give, or actually giving something of value.
Of an Undue Advantage: The "something of value" (money, gift, favor, information, etc.), regardless of its size, if it's intended to induce improper action.
To Induce or Reward: The corrupt intent to influence an official or individual to act or refrain from acting in a way that benefits the bribe-giver. This intent is crucial.
Improper Performance: The action or inaction relates to a public or business duty performed improperly, dishonestly, or in breach of trust.
Direct or Indirect: The bribe can be given or received directly by the individual, or indirectly through intermediaries, agents, or third parties.
Slide 6: Red Flags and High-Risk Areas
Understanding Red Flags
Red flags are warning signs that indicate a higher risk of corruption or bribery. Recognizing them is the first step towards prevention. They are not proof of wrongdoing but signal the need for heightened scrutiny and due diligence.
Interacting with Public Officials
Requests for "speed money" or unofficial payments: Any demand for cash or informal payments to expedite or process routine government actions, even if it seems small or customary.
Unusual requests for donations or sponsorship: Especially to individuals, political parties, or unknown charities linked to public officials, or where there's no clear business purpose.
Officials pushing for a specific third-party vendor or consultant: Insisting on using a particular company without competitive bidding or justification.
Lack of transparency in government processes: Unclear procedures, absence of written records, or insistence on verbal agreements in official dealings.
High-value gifts or hospitality requests: Demands for luxurious travel, expensive entertainment, or significant gifts not aligned with official protocol or company policy.
Third-Party Relationships (Agents, Consultants, Vendors, JVs)
Questionable Reputation: Parties known for unethical practices, past corruption allegations, or operating in high-risk jurisdictions.
Unusual Payment Terms: Demands for payments in cash, to offshore accounts, to bank accounts in different names (e.g., personal accounts), or through shell companies.
Disproportionate Fees: High commissions, success fees, or retainers that seem excessive for the services rendered, or are inconsistent with market rates.
Lack of Clear Scope of Work: No written contract, vague descriptions of services, or inability to articulate what they will do to earn their fee.
Requests for large upfront payments: Especially when unrelated to actual work milestones.
Refusal to provide due diligence information: Reluctance to share financial statements, ownership details, or references.
Family/Political connections: Third parties with close ties to public officials relevant to our business.
Gifts, Hospitality, and Entertainment (GHE)
Frequent or lavish gifts: Exceeding company policy limits or local customs, especially to those in a position to influence business decisions or regulatory outcomes.
Travel or accommodation expenses: Offered for public officials or their family members that are not directly related to legitimate, documented business purposes.
Lack of clear policy or approval process: Uncontrolled or undocumented spending on GHE, leading to potential misuse.
Gifts made in secret or not declared.
Procurement and Tendering
Lack of competitive bidding: Single-source contracts without strong, documented justification.
Tailored specifications: Requirements that appear designed to favor only one specific bidder, excluding others.
Unexplained changes in contract terms: Amendments made after the tender process without clear, documented business reasons.
Sudden inclusion of new third parties late in the procurement process.
Unusual timing: Contracts awarded right before a key official leaves office.
Other Red Flags
Anonymous or irregular complaints: Frequent, non-specific allegations of unethical behavior from internal or external sources.
Employees living beyond their known means: A sudden, unexplained increase in an employee's lifestyle.
Requests to backdate documents or misrepresent facts: Attempts to alter records to conceal transactions or inflate figures.
Weak internal controls or lack of segregation of duties: Inadequate oversight, allowing one person to control an entire financial transaction process.
High staff turnover in key financial or compliance roles.
Company operates in a country or industry with a high perceived risk of corruption.

Personal Financial Ruin: Legal defense costs, penalties, and confiscation of assets can lead to significant financial hardship.
Company Consequences: Potentially Catastrophic
Significant Financial Penalties:
Massive Fines: Levied by Indian authorities (e.g., under PCA, PMLA) and international bodies (e.g., DOJ/SEC for FCPA, SFO for UK Bribery Act), potentially running into millions or billions of dollars.
Disgorgement of Profits: Forfeiture of all profits derived from corrupt activities.
Remediation Costs: Expenses incurred to overhaul compliance programs, hire external monitors, and conduct internal investigations.
Reputational Damage:
Public Scandal: Widespread negative media coverage, headlines, and public outcry.
Brand Erosion: Loss of customer loyalty, decreased sales, and difficulty in marketing products/services.
Loss of Credibility: Among investors, partners, and employees, impacting market valuation and strategic alliances.
Legal & Regulatory Scrutiny:
Intensified Audits and Investigations: Prolonged and costly investigations by multiple enforcement agencies (e.g., CBI, ED, CVC in India; DOJ, SEC, SFO internationally).
Debarment from Government Contracts: Companies found guilty of corruption are often blacklisted from participating in government tenders for years.
Imposition of Compliance Monitors: External experts appointed by regulators to oversee and report on the company's compliance efforts for a specified period.
Loss of Licenses/Permits: Essential business licenses may be revoked.
Loss of Investor Confidence: Plummeting stock prices, reduced investment, and difficulty in raising capital.

Case Studies (Illustrative Examples of Real-World Impact)
Cognizant (India): A US-based IT services firm, paid over $25 million in penalties to the SEC for bribing Indian officials to obtain building permits, violating the FCPA. The case highlighted the need for robust internal controls and due diligence on third parties, even for routine matters. (Source: SEC, DOJ)
Oracle (India): Another US tech giant, paid $23 million to the SEC for FCPA violations, where employees of its Indian subsidiary created "slush funds" with distributors by granting excessive discounts, which were then used for unauthorized payments to government officials. This demonstrates risks in sales and channel partner relationships. (Source: SEC)
CDM Smith (India): A US engineering and construction firm, faced FCPA disgorgement (approx. $34 million) and local FIRs in India, after its employees bribed National Highway Authority of India officials for contracts. The bribes were disguised as "Allowable Business Expenditure" in tax returns, highlighting accounting fraud risks. (Source: DOJ)
(Optional - if appropriate for your audience): The 2G Spectrum Scam / Commonwealth Games Scam: These major Indian scams demonstrated the vast scale of corruption, its significant financial drain on public resources, and the profound impact on national reputation and public trust. While these are broad national issues, they underscore the environment in which businesses operate.
Slide 10: Best Practices for a Robust Compliance Program
Building an Effective Anti-Corruption & Anti-Bribery Program
A truly effective ABAC program is not just about having policies, but about embedding a culture of integrity throughout the organization.
Strong Tone from the Top & Middle:
Leadership Commitment: Senior management must visibly and consistently demonstrate unwavering commitment to integrity and zero tolerance for corruption. Their actions and communication set the ethical benchmark.
Middle Management Buy-in: Managers must understand and champion the policy, actively promoting ethical behavior within their teams and leading by example.
Comprehensive Policies & Procedures:
Clear and Accessible: Develop clear, concise, and easily accessible policies on ABAC, gifts & hospitality, facilitation payments, third-party due diligence, conflicts of interest, etc. Ensure they are translated into local languages where necessary.
Regular Review & Update: Periodically review and update policies to reflect changes in laws, regulations, business operations, and evolving risk landscapes (e.g., new markets, new products).
Regular and Tailored Training:
Mandatory & Ongoing: Provide mandatory, recurrent training for all employees, especially those in high-risk roles (e.g., sales, procurement, finance, legal, government relations).
Engaging & Practical: Training should be interactive, scenario-based, and include real-life examples relevant to the Indian context. Tailor content to specific departments and their unique risks.
Effective Risk Assessment:
Continuous Process: Conduct periodic and dynamic assessments to identify, analyze, and prioritize specific bribery and corruption risks across all operations, geographies, and business interactions (e.g., with public officials, third parties).
Informed Controls: Use the risk assessment findings to design and implement proportionate and effective internal controls.
Robust Due Diligence:
Thorough Vetting: Implement a systematic and risk-based process for conducting thorough background checks and integrity due diligence on all third parties (agents, distributors, consultants, joint venture partners, M&A targets) before engagement.
Ongoing Monitoring: Regularly monitor third-party relationships for any red flags or changes in risk profiles.
Strong Internal Controls:
Financial & Accounting Controls: Implement robust financial and accounting controls (e.g., clear approval matrices, segregation of duties, regular internal and external audits, expense management systems) to prevent and detect corrupt payments and ensure financial transparency.
Non-Financial Controls: Implement non-financial controls like clear procurement processes, contract management oversight, and data analytics to identify anomalies.
Accessible Reporting Mechanisms:
Multiple Channels: Provide multiple, trusted, and well-communicated channels for employees to report concerns confidentially and, where possible, anonymously (e.g., dedicated ethics hotline, secure online portal, direct access to Compliance Officer).
Culture of Trust: Foster a culture where employees feel safe and encouraged to "speak up" without fear of retaliation.
Consistent Enforcement & Disciplinary Action:
Fair & Prompt: Ensure that all reported violations are investigated promptly, impartially, and thoroughly.
Proportionate Sanctions: Apply consistent and proportionate disciplinary actions (including termination of employment and legal action where warranted) against individuals involved in bribery or corruption, regardless of their position.
Continuous Monitoring & Review:
Program Effectiveness: Regularly monitor and test the effectiveness of the ABAC program.
Learning & Adapting: Review internal audit findings, incident reports, feedback from employees, and legal updates to make necessary adjustments and continuously improve the program.
Slide 11: Key Takeaways - Our Shared Commitment to Integrity
Remember These Core Principles - They Are Your Shield and Our Strength:
Corruption and bribery are not just abstract concepts; they are serious offenses with profound and severe legal, financial, and reputational consequences for both individuals and the entire organization. The personal risks are immense.
India's legal framework is robust and actively enforced, working in conjunction with powerful extraterritorial laws. There is no safe harbor for corrupt acts, and ignorance of the law is never an excuse.
Every single employee plays a critical and indispensable role in preventing corruption. Your understanding of this policy, your vigilance in identifying red flags, and your commitment to ethical behavior are paramount.
"If you see something, say something." Do not hesitate to report any suspected unethical or illegal conduct through the established, confidential, and protected channels. Speaking up is a duty and a vital protection for yourself and the company.
Upholding integrity and ethical conduct is not merely about compliance; it is the fundamental cornerstone of our values. It builds lasting trust with our clients, partners, and employees, protects our reputation, and ensures our sustainable growth and success in India and globally.
